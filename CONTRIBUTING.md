Contributing Code
====================

We appreciate your contributions to this repository! Since our infrastructure might make things a little different from usual processes, we wanted to clarify our specific process.

TUNE maintains internal repositories for our external Github SDKs and plugins repositories, and we only push one way (from internal to external repositories.) So, while we can't directly merge in your pull requests, if accepted we'll incorporate your changes into our internal repository to be included in our external releases. In any case, after review we'll close your pull requests and let you know if your changes have been included as-is, rejected, or accepted with adjustments.

Thanks again for helping us make our code the best it can be!
